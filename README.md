# C-PROGRAMMING-MINI-PROJECT
c compiler in c identifying 15 syntax errors
   
I have created a basic c compiler that identify syntax errors given by the user 
I have used the following logic and steps
1. making a 2D array and storing the values given by the user in it
2. the accepting of values will stop only when the user enter "exit"
3. then the program will read the codes provided by user line by line
4. the program will then identify the errors in the syntax in the code
5. then program will display the errors
   
I have included the following functions for identification of errors
1. int main()
2. return
3. semicolon
4. parenthesis
5. scanf
6. printf
7. all type of loops
8. 1D array
9.and many more 

 2. graphics in c
